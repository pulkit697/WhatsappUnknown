WhatsApp doesn't offer the facility to message a number till it is not saved in your contacts.
It becomes an issue when you have to message someone for one time and hence you don't want to save his number and make your contacts messy.
Hence, this app enables the user to send message to any number without saving it in the contacts. 

The user can open this app to enter a number in the space provided to open that contact in WhatsApp.
The user also has the option to use this app when he is copying any text,without opening the app himself.
